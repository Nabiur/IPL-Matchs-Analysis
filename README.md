🔧 Requirements
To run the notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
Other optional libraries might include:

plotly for interactive visualizations

scikit-learn for statistical modeling (if applied)

🧠 Key Analyses Performed
The notebook includes:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling null values

Filtering irrelevant data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Top-performing teams and players

Win/loss patterns by venue, toss, and batting order

Visualization of match outcomes

Insights and Visualization

Graphs and charts using matplotlib and seaborn

Comparative analysis (team vs team, player vs player)

Statistical Insights (Optional)

Probability-based insights (e.g., chance of winning toss and match)

Basic predictive patterns (if included)

📊 Sample Visualizations
Bar plots of top run-scorers and wicket-takers

Heatmaps of match venues vs team wins

Pie charts of win percentages

Time-series of wins by season

📁 Dataset Used
The analysis uses publicly available IPL datasets (typically in .csv format) containing:

Match details (teams, scores, toss, results)

Player-level data (runs, wickets, strike rates)

Ensure the dataset files are in the correct relative paths or update the file paths in the notebook accordingly.

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repo or download the files

Open IPL_data_analysis_final.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Run the notebook cells step-by-step

✅ Output
You’ll gain valuable insights into:

Dominant teams and players

Impact of toss decisions

Seasonal performance trends

📌 Future Improvements
Add machine learning models to predict match outcomes

Create interactive dashboards with Plotly or Streamlit

Integrate real-time data fetching from Cricbuzz or ESPNcricinfo
